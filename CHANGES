* Added initial support for placing the helper itself (appengine_django
  directory) into a zipfile named appengine_django.zip in the top level
  project directory. Note. That manage.py commands will not work when using
  a zipped appengine_django.

September 2008
==============

* Added support for loading Django from a file named django.zip in the top
  level project directory.
* Improved session backend contributed by Bernd Dorn of Lovely Systems.

Tue 19 August 2008
==================

Support for versions of Django less than 1.0beta_1 has been removed. If you
wish to continue using Django 0.96 you will need to stay with revision 53 of
the Google App Engine Helper for Django.

Wed 6 August 2008
=================

This is the last version of the Google App Engine Helper for Django that will
support Django 0.96. Future development of the helper will be targetted for the
upcoming 1.0 release of Django.

* Improved SDK detection on Windows by looking at both the PATH variable that
  may be set by the installer and using the win32api module (if available) to
  look for the SDK in the default Program Files location.
* Replaced the startapp command with a version that installs an App Engine
  Compatible application skeleton. Patch contributed by Andi Albrecht.
* Changed the default runserver port to 8000 to match standard Django
  behaviour. Path contributed by Waldemar Kornewald.
* Email server settings from the Django settings file are provided to the App
  Engine Mail API. Patch contributed by Waldemar Kornewald.
* Added support for the Django memcache cache backend. Patch contributed by
  Jonca Rafal.
* Added support for the Django session middle with db and cache backends for
  Django 1.0alpha only. Patches contributed by Jonca Rafal and Waldemar
  Kornewald.
* Moved the Django compatible login_required decorator to the standard Django
  location. Patch contributed by Andi Albrecht.
* Replaced the Django ModelForm class with the App Engine ModelForm class.
* Added a repr implementation for the BaseModel class.
* Many minor improvements to increase robustness and avoid errors if portions
  of Django are not present.

Tue 20 May 2008
===============

* Added an App Engine compatible implementation of the Django authentication
  framework. This only works for Users at the present time, Groups and
  Permissions are not yet supported.

  The patch for this functionality was supplied by Andi Albrecht.

* Added equality and inequality comparision functions to BaseModel.

  The patch for this functionality was supplied by Andi Albrecht.


Fri 16 May 2008
===============

* Changed location of local SDK directory to '.google_appengine' instead of
  'google_appengine' so that it is automatically ignored without neding to
  modify skip_files in app.yaml. 'google_appengine' will continue to work for
  the next few releases.

* Major improvements to SDK location detection code. When running on Windows or
  Mac OS with the SDK installed via the Google supplied installers the SDK will
  be automatically detected and added to Python's path.

* The helper now detects, warns and removes Context Processors that are not
  compatible with Google App Engine.

* The Django mail API is now monkey patched to allow email to be sent via the
  App Engine Mail API using the standard Django mail functions. This code does
  not yet support sending multipart / HTML emails.

  The patch for this functionality was supplied by Ryan Gates.

* Added 'update', 'rollback' and 'vacuum_indexes' from appcfg.py to the list of
  commands available via manage.py when using Django 0.97. You will still have
  to uses appcfg.py directly if you are using Django 0.96.

* Improved the deserialization routines to deserialize parent references
  without needing to instantiate the parent instance. This allows instances
  with non-existant parents to be succesfully loaded.
