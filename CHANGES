===============

* Added an App Engine compatible implementation of the Django authentication
  framework. This only works for Users at the present time, Groups and
  Permissions are not yet supported.

  The patch for this functionality was supplied by Andi Albrecht.

===============

* Changed location of local SDK directory to '.google_appengine' instead of
  'google_appengine' so that it is automatically ignored without neding to
  modify skip_files in app.yaml. 'google_appengine' will continue to work for
  the next few releases.

* Major improvements to SDK location detection code. When running on Windows or
  Mac OS with the SDK installed via the Google supplied installers the SDK will
  be automatically detected and added to Python's path.

* The helper now detects, warns and removes Context Processors that are not
  compatible with Google App Engine.

* The Django mail API is now monkey patched to allow email to be sent via the
  App Engine Mail API using the standard Django mail functions. This code does
  not yet support sending multipart / HTML emails.

  The patch for this functionality was supplied by Ryan Gates.

* Added 'update', 'rollback' and 'vacuum_indexes' from appcfg.py to the list of
  commands available via manage.py when using Django 0.97. You will still have
  to uses appcfg.py directly if you are using Django 0.96.

* Improved the deserialization routines to deserialize parent references
  without needing to instantiate the parent instance. This allows instances
  with non-existant parents to be succesfully loaded.
