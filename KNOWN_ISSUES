Known Issues with the Google App Engine Helper for Django
=========================================================

* manage.py commands do not work when appengine_django.zip is used

When running with the helper itself contained within a zipfile the additional
and modified manage.py commands do not work. I suspect this is due to Django
not appropriately accounting for the zipfile when trying to locate the
replacement commands.


There are no other known issues with the helper at this time. See the issue
tracker at http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-django/issues/list for
up to date information on bugs and feature requests.
