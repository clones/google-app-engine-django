Known Issues with the Google App Engine Helper for Django
=========================================================

* If you have installed Django as part of your regular Python installation you
  may experience problems. Removing it from the site-packages directory will
  relieve this.

  To use a local copy of Django you can place it in the 'django' subdirectory
  of your project.

* Uploading files encounters issues when using the development app_server.
