Known Issues with the Google App Engine Helper for Django
=========================================================

* Support for the skip_files option in app.yaml is not working in the current
  SDK release. This means that if you have chosen to put a copy of the Google
  App Engine SDK inside your project at google_appengine/ you will need to
  remove it before running appcfg.py or you will upload the entire SDK to your
  account, taking up more of your file quota than is necessary.

  This is tracked in the SDK issue tracker at:
  http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=80

  Please see that issue for several workarounds that you may use until an
  updated SDK is released.
